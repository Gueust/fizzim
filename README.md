======

Finite State Machine design tool using Java 1.7.

Fizzim on the web:  www.fizzim.com

Development is currently done using Eclipse (Kepler).
The GUI is done using the WindowBuilder plugin.

Development
-----------

Using Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (See http://semver.org/)

A large part of the application was refactored, and a general panel to modify
the values of attributes have been added to the transition and state editor.


Localization
------------

Fizzim uses the java localization system and its ResourceBundles. The files
are in UTF-8.
From now, only the deeply refactored parts are localized (i.e. transition and
state editors).
